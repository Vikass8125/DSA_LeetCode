Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.
For an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.
This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
x denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.

Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. 
This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

 

Example 1:

Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
Example 2:

Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
 

Constraints:

1 <= data.length <= 2 * 104
0 <= data[i] <= 255

HINTS:
Read the data integer by integer. When you read it, process the least significant 8 bits of it.

Assume the next encoding is 1-byte data. If it is not 1-byte data, read the next integer and assume it is 2-bytes data.

Similarly, if it is not 2-bytes data, try 3-bytes then 4-bytes. If you read four integers and it still does not match any pattern, return false.


MY_SOLUTION

Solution
Intuition

This is an interesting problem to work with especially because it is not really hard to code up a solution for, but,
you really need to pay attention to the details of the problem. 
A lot of people trying to solve the problem tend to miss out on small details that are mentioned and end up getting 1 or 2 test cases wrong.

Note: The following section provides 3 different examples for the problem and explains them.
If the test cases and the rules are clear to you, you can skip over the Approach 1.

The problem statement provides 2 different examples for you to understand the rules to define a valid UTF-8 charset.
That might not be enough for a lot of people and so the first thing we would do is try to understand all the rules given in the problem 
statement and in the meantime look at a few examples in detail that will help clarify the problem. Here are the rules in the question statement:

A valid UTF-8 character can be 1 - 4 bytes long.
For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode.
For an n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all ones, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.
The input given would be an array of integers containing the data. We have to return if the data in the array represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. 
The important thing to note here is that the array doesn't contain data for just a single character. 
As can be seen from the first example, the array can contain data for multiple characters all of which can be valid UTF-8 characters
and hence the charset represented by the array is valid.
Another important thing to note is that the integers in the array can be larger than 255 as well. The highest number that can be represented by 8 bits is 255.
So, what do we do if an integer in the array is say, 476? According to the Note in the problem before the examples, 
we only have to consider the 8 least significant bits of each integer in the array.
Now that we have our rules defined for us, let us first look at the examples in the question and then some other examples from the discussion section that
seem to cause a lot of confusion.

Example 1

data = [197, 130, 1]
Let us look at the octet sequence represented by the integers in this array. So, the octet sequence would be as follows:

11000101 10000010 00000001
Remember, for an n-bytes UTF-8 character, the first n-bits would be 1 followed by a 0 in the n+1 bit.
Then, the next n - 1 bytes would all have 10 as their most significant bits.

[1 1 0] 0 0 1 0 1
 ↑   ↑
Clearly, we can see that the 2 most significant bits of this byte are 1s and they are followed by a 0.
This implies the start of a valid UTF-8 character. The information that we can gather from this byte is that this is a 2-byte UTF-8 character.
This means that the next byte in the sequence must follow the pattern 10xxxxxx. Let's see if it does.

[1 1 0] 0 0 1 0 1    [1 0] 0 0 0 0 1 0
 ↑   ↑                ↑ ↑
Yes, it does follow the intended sequence and hence the first two integers in the array i.e. 197 130 combine to form a valid 2-byte UTF-8 character. 
Since there are more elements left in the array, we move on and check them in a similar fashion as we did with the numbers above.
The next integer in the array is 1. Let's look at the binary representation for this integer.

00000001
Since the most significant bit itself of this number is a 0, the only rule it satisfies is the 1-byte UTF-8 character rule. Let's re-iterate the rule:

For 1-byte character, the first bit or the most significant but is a 0, followed by its unicode code.

[0] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
 ↑
Clearly, the integer 1 is a valid 1-byte UTF-8 character in itself.
Since there are no more elements left in the array to process, we will return True since there were two characters present in the array and both of 
them were valid UTF-8 encoded characters.

Example 2

[235, 140, 4]
This is the second example that's mentioned in the problem statement. As before, let us look at the binary representation of the integers in the array.

11101011 10001100 00000100
Let's start with the first integer in our array. The first byte will tell us the length of the UTF-8 character and hence the number of bytes we have to process
in all in order to completely process a single UTF-8 character in the array before moving on to another one.

[1 1 1 0] 1 0 1 1
 ↑     ↑
So, the first few bits of the byte above are 1110. This means that our UTF-8 character is of 3 bytes in all. 
Remember the rule that helps us identify the size of a potential UTF-8 character from it's first byte.

For an n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0.

Following this rule we determined that the first UTF-8 character is of 3 bytes. 
Since we are done processing one byte of data, we are left with 2 other bytes of data to process before starting with another UTF-8 character. 
Let's look at the remaining two bytes of the array.

[1 0] 0 0 1 1 0 0       0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
 ↑ ↑                    ↑ (WRONG!)
The first byte above follows our pattern of 10xxxxxx but the second byte does not. We had to verify a UTF-8 encoded 3-byte character as we 
saw from the first byte of the sequence 11101011. The final byte is something that doesn't adhere to our rules mentioned before.
Since we found an invalid byte, we can simply return False and we don't need to process any data further.

Example 3

We will look at one final example before moving onto the solution for this problem.
This example has caused a lot of confusion as can be seen from multiple posts on the discussion forum:


[250,145,145,145,145]
Let us look at the binary representation of all the integers in the array.

11111010 10010001 10010001 10010001 10010001
As we have been doing in the previous two examples, let us look at the first byte of data to determine how many number of bytes our UTF-8 encoded character will have.
Looking at the first byte of data we can see that our first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence of data given, is of 5 bytes.

[1 1 1 1 1 0] 1 0
 ↑         ↑  
If this is a valid UTF-8 encoded character, the following four bytes of data should be in accordance with the pattern 10xxxxxx.
Let's look at the next 4 bytes of data one on each line.

1. [1 0] 0 1 0 0 0 1
2. [1 0] 0 1 0 0 0 1
3. [1 0] 0 1 0 0 0 1
4. [1 0] 0 1 0 0 0 1
As we can see above, all the 4 bytes are in accordance with the rules specified in the problem. 
Why then the result for this specific test case, False? People tend to miss out on one of the rules mentioned in the problem.

This is the first rule in the problem statement and it clearly says that "A valid UTF-8 character can be 1 - 4 bytes long."

The first byte of data indicates that the UTF-8 encoded character contains 5 bytes of data which cannot be true.
This is why the answer for this specific test case is False.

Hopefully, most of your doubts would have been cleared by the three examples that we looked at above. Let us now move on to the solution(s) for this problem.


Approach 1: String Manipulation.
The problem itself is not that complicated. As long as we adhere to the rules specified in the problem, we should be fine. 
So, let's jump straight in and look at the algorithm.

Algorithm

Start processing the integers in the given array one by one.
For every integer, obtain the binary representation in the string format.
Since integers can be very large, we should only keep/consider the 8 least significant bits of data and discard the rest as mentioned in the problem statement.
After this step, you should have 8-bits or 1-byte string representation for the integer. Let the string we get here be called bin_rep.
There are two scenarios that we need to consider here in the next step.
One is that we are in the middle of processing some UTF-8 encoded character. 
In this case we simply need to check the first two bits of the string and see if they are 10 i.e. the 2 most significant bits of the integer being 1 and 0.
bin_rep[:2] == "10"
The other case is that we already processed some valid UTF-8 characters and we have to start processing a new UTF-8 character. 
In that case we have to look at a prefix of the string representation and look at the number of 1s that we encounter before encountering a 0. 
This will tell us the size of the next UTF-8 character.
We keep on processing the integers of the array in this way until we either end up processing all of them or we find an invalid scenario.
Let us move on to the implementation of this algorithm.

class Solution {
  public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {

    // Number of bytes in the current UTF-8 character
    int numberOfBytesToProcess = 0;

    // For each integer in the data array.
    for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {

      // Get the binary representation. We only need the least significant 8 bits
      // for any given number.
      String binRep = Integer.toBinaryString(data[i]);
      binRep =
          binRep.length() >= 8
              ? binRep.substring(binRep.length() - 8)
              : "00000000".substring(binRep.length() % 8) + binRep;

      // If this is the case then we are to start processing a new UTF-8 character.
      if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {

        // Get the number of 1s in the beginning of the string.
        for (int j = 0; j < binRep.length(); j++) {
          if (binRep.charAt(j) == '0') {
            break;
          }

          numberOfBytesToProcess += 1;
        }

        // 1 byte characters
        if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {
          continue;
        }

        // Invalid scenarios according to the rules of the problem.
        if (numberOfBytesToProcess > 4 || numberOfBytesToProcess == 1) {
          return false;
        }

      } else {

        // Else, we are processing integers which represent bytes which are a part of
        // a UTF-8 character. So, they must adhere to the pattern `10xxxxxx`.
        if (!(binRep.charAt(0) == '1' && binRep.charAt(1) == '0')) {
          return false;
        }
      }

      // We reduce the number of bytes to process by 1 after each integer.
      numberOfBytesToProcess -= 1;
    }

    // This is for the case where we might not have the complete data for
    // a particular UTF-8 character.
    return numberOfBytesToProcess == 0;
  }
}


Complexity analysis

Time Complexity : O(N) since we process each integer of the array and for each integer we obtain an 8 character string which we then use for further processing.
Overall the complexity is O(N) considering N is the number of integers in the array.
Space Complexity: O(N) since for every integer we create a new string that we play around with.

===========================================================

Approach 2: Bit Manipulation
The previous solution is exactly what the problem asks us to do except that the string conversion and manipulation takes a lot of time and that is 
something unnecessary. We can make use of bit manipulation to perform the same task.

Let us look at what parts of a byte corresponding to an integer do we need to process.

If it is the starting byte for a UTF-8 character, then we need to process the first N bits where NN will be at max 4. 
Anything more than that and we would have an invalid character.
In case the byte is a part of a UTF-8 character, then we simply need to check the first two bits or the most significant bits. 
The most significant bit needs to be a 1 and the second most significant bit needs to be a 0.
Let's see how we can make use of bit manipulation to perform both of these tasks.

mask = 1 << 7
while mask & num:
    n_bytes += 1
    mask = mask >> 1
So, we have taken a mask = 1 << 7 which is basically 10000000.
We will make use of this mask and logically and it with the number to see if the bit at a particular position is set of not. 
We do this iteratively to check how many bits are set starting from the most significant bit 
(Remember, the integer might be too large but we should only process the 8 least significant bits of data.)

To check if the most significant bit is a 1 and the second most significant bit is a 0, we can make use of the following two masks

mask1 = 1 << 7
mask2 = 1 << 6

if not (num & mask1 and not (num & mask2)):
    return False
The above code will simple use the mask1 to check if the most significant bit is set to 1 and the second most significant bit is set to 0. 
if this is not a case, then we return False.

Let's move onto the implementation.


class Solution {
    public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {

        // Number of bytes in the current UTF-8 character
        int numberOfBytesToProcess = 0;

        // Masks to check two most significant bits in a byte.
        int mask1 = 1 << 7;
        int mask2 = 1 << 6;

        // For each integer in the data array.
        for(int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            // If this is the case then we are to start processing a new UTF-8 character.
            if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {
                int mask = 1 << 7;
                 while ((mask & data[i]) != 0) {
                    numberOfBytesToProcess += 1;
                    mask = mask >> 1;
                 }

                // 1 byte characters
                if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {
                    continue;
                }

                // Invalid scenarios according to the rules of the problem.
                if (numberOfBytesToProcess > 4 || numberOfBytesToProcess == 1) {
                    return false;
                }

            } else {

                // data[i] should have most significant bit set and
                // second most significant bit unset. So, we use the two masks
                // to make sure this is the case.
                if (!((data[i] & mask1) != 0 && (mask2 & data[i]) == 0)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }

            // We reduce the number of bytes to process by 1 after each integer.
            numberOfBytesToProcess -= 1;
        }

        // This is for the case where we might not have the complete data for
        // a particular UTF-8 character.
        return numberOfBytesToProcess == 0;
    }
}

Our objective
To translate the provided data array into a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters

Approach
To solve this, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Start with count = 0.

Step 2: for i ranging from 0 to the size of the data array.

Step 2.1: Take the value from data arra and store it in x  = data[i]

Step 2.2: If the count is 0, then

If x/32 = 110, then set count as 1. (x/32 is same as doing x >> 5 as 2^5 = 32)

Else if x/16 = 1110, then count = 2 (x/16 is same as doing x >> 4 as 2^4 = 16)

Else If x/8 = 11110, then count = 3. (x/8 is same as doing x >> 3 as 2^3 = 8)

Else if x/128 is 0, then return false. (x/128 is same as doing x >> 7 as 2^7 = 128)

Step 2.3: Else If x/64 is not 10, then return false and decrease the count by 1.

Step 3: When the count is 0, return true.

// https://leetcode.com/problems/utf-8-validation/discuss/493355/Java-DFA-solution-with-explanation

Intuition
It's obviously a bit manipulation problem. But also there are lots of states need to be considered. 
An encoded UTF-8 character is possiblely represented by 1 to 4 bytes, which actually depends on the first byte. 
So after we have encountered the first byte, the next following 0 ~ 3 byte(s) must satisfy some constraints. 
Isn't it like a state machine? Namely, DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton).
Algorithm
Follow me up to build the DFA. Input is a byte represented by an integer and initial state is 0 (clear, all previous bytes are handled). 
Then all the valid inputs are 0xxxxxxx, 110xxxxx, 1110xxxxx, 11110xxx. So state 0 can transfer to four states.
Wait, just think of the input 0xxxxxxx: it means a single byte UTF-8 character, so all the previous byte are cleared again. 
Here I directly give the DFA. Any question is welcome.
image
We take a quick glance of the longest path 0 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 0, which is relate to a 4-byte UTF-8 character. 
After encounters four bytes (11110xxx, 10xxxxxx, 10xxxxxx, 10xxxxxx in order), the state return to 0 again.
Any other inputs are illegal and will result validation failure. State 0 is the initial state and the final state.

The bit manipulation method involves shifting the bits to get only the bit value of importance:

1 byte = 0xxxxxxx
2 bytes = 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
3 bytes = 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
4 bytes = 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
We can then use a counter to keep track, if we are in the case for 2, 3 or 4 bytes.

    public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int value : data) {
            if (count == 0) {
                if (value >> 3 == 0b11110) {
                    count = 3;
                } else if (value >> 4 == 0b1110) {
                    count = 2;
                } else if (value >> 5 == 0b110) {
                    count = 1;
                } else if (value >> 7 == 0b0) {
                    count = 0;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                if (value >> 6 == 0b10) {
                    count--;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return count == 0;
    }
If you are unfamiliar with bit manipulation, here is a solution that check for the value of the integers:

0xxxxxxx
<= 127
10xxxxxx
>= 128 && <= 191
110xxxxx
>= 192 && <= 223
1110xxxx
>= 224 && <= 239
11110xxx
>= 240 && <= 247
public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int integer : data) {
            if (integer > 247) {
                return false;
            }
            if (count == 0) {
                if (integer >= 240) {
                    count = 3;
                } else if (integer >= 224) {
                    count = 2;
                } else if (integer >= 192) {
                    count = 1;
                } else if (integer >= 128) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                if (integer >= 128 && integer <= 191) {
                    count--;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

I am using masking and matching to check the prefixes. It is similar to how IP subnet masks work.

For the maks, we only set bit to 1 at positions that we want to track and leave the rest at 0.
Then, we can match the resulting values with the prefix values. The prefix value is just the header bits with the rest bits filled with 0s.

Let's takes a look at 110xxxxx as an example.
We only need to check the first three bits and ignore the others so the mask is 11100000 and the prefix value is 11000000.

Let's test 10100110, 11011110, and 11010101 with our mask and prefixes.
First, filter out all other bits with the mask and AND operator.

10100110 & 11100000 = 10100000 <- Not equal to 11000000
11011110 & 11100000 = 11000000 <- Equal to 11000000
11010101 & 11100000 = 11000000 <- Equal to 11000000

As you can see, the first test will return false since the headers do not match.
In the latter two cases, the five least significant bits are removed by the mask so they both return the same prefix value.

Now, I just expanded this to all the headers and tails with precomputed values.

class Solution {
    public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {
		// Create precomputed arrays with the mask and prefixes.
		// Bitwise representation: [ [10000000,00000000],
		//                           [11100000,11000000],
		//                           [11110000,11100000],
		//                           [11111000,11110000]]
        int[][] headers = new int[][]{{128,0},{224,192},{240,224},{248,240}};
		
		// Bitwise representation: [11000000,10000000]
        int[] tail = new int[]{192,128};
        
        for(int i = 0; i < data.length; ++i){
			// Find which header matches
            int num = -1;
            for(int j = 0; j < 4; ++j){
                if((data[i]&headers[j][0])==headers[j][1]){
                    num=j;
                    break;
                }
            }
			// No match or there isn't enough data left
            if(num==-1 || i+num>=data.length)
                return false;
            
			// Check the remaining tail bytes
            for(int j = 0; j < num; ++j){
                if((data[++i]&tail[0])!=tail[1])
                    return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
