Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.
Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
Example 2:


Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

Approach #1 Using Depth First Search [Accepted]
Algorithm

One of the methods to solve the given problem is to make use of Depth First Search. 
In DFS, we try to exhaust each branch of the given tree during the tree traversal before moving onto the next branch.

To make use of DFS to solve the given problem, we make use of two lists countcount and resres.
Here, count[i]count[i] refers to the total number of nodes found at the i^{th} level(counting from root at level 0) till now, 
and res[i]res[i] refers to the sum of the nodes at the i^{th} level encountered till now during the Depth First Search.

We make use of a function average(t, i, res, count), which is used to fill the resres and countcount array if we start the DFS from the node tt at the i^{th} 
level in the given tree. We start by making the function call average(root, 0, res, count). 

After this, we do the following at every step:
->Add the value of the current node to the resres(or sumsum) at the index corresponding to the current level. 
  Also, increment the countcount at the index corresponding to the current level.
->Call the same function, average, with the left and the right child of the current node. Also, update the current level used in making the function call.
->Repeat the above steps till all the nodes in the given tree have been considered once.
->Populate the averages in the resultant array to be returned.

 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public List < Double > averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        List < Integer > count = new ArrayList < > ();
        List < Double > res = new ArrayList < > ();
        average(root, 0, res, count);
        for (int i = 0; i < res.size(); i++)
            res.set(i, res.get(i) / count.get(i));
        return res;
    }
    public void average(TreeNode t, int i, List < Double > sum, List < Integer > count) {
        if (t == null)
            return;
        if (i < sum.size()) {
            sum.set(i, sum.get(i) + t.val);
            count.set(i, count.get(i) + 1);
        } else {
            sum.add(1.0 * t.val);
            count.add(1);
        }
        average(t.left, i + 1, sum, count);
        average(t.right, i + 1, sum, count);
    }
}


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n). The whole tree is traversed once only. Here, n refers to the total number of nodes in the given binary tree.

Space complexity : O(h). resres and countcount array of size h are used. 
Here, h refers to the height(maximum number of levels) of the given binary tree. Further, the depth of the recursive tree could go upto h only.

Approach #2 Breadth First Search [Accepted]
Algorithm

Another method to solve the given problem is to make use of a Breadth First Search. 
In BFS, we start by pushing the root node into a queue. 
Then, we remove an element(node) from the front of the queue.
For every node removed from the queue, we add all its children to the back of the same queuequeue. 
We keep on continuing this process till the queuequeue becomes empty. In this way, we can traverse the given tree on a level-by-level basis.

But, in the current implementation, we need to do a slight modification, since we need to separate the nodes on one level from that of the other.

The steps to be performed are listed below:
->Put the root node into the queuequeue.
->Initialize sumsum and countcount as 0 and temptemp as an empty queue.
->Pop a node from the front of the queuequeue. Add this node's value to the sumsum corresponding to the current level. 
 Also, update the countcount corresponding to the current level.
->Put the children nodes of the node last popped into the a temp queue(instead of queue).
->Continue steps 3 and 4 till queuequeue becomes empty. (An empty queuequeue indicates that one level of the tree has been considered).
->Reinitialize queuequeue with its value as temptemp.
->Populate the resres array with the average corresponding to the current level.
->Repeat steps 2 to 7 till the queuequeue and temptemp become empty.
At the end, resres is the required result.

 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public List < Double > averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        List < Double > res = new ArrayList < > ();
        Queue < TreeNode > queue = new LinkedList < > ();
        queue.add(root);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            long sum = 0, count = 0;
            Queue < TreeNode > temp = new LinkedList < > ();
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                TreeNode n = queue.remove();
                sum += n.val;
                count++;
                if (n.left != null)
                    temp.add(n.left);
                if (n.right != null)
                    temp.add(n.right);
            }
            queue = temp;
            res.add(sum * 1.0 / count);
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n). The whole tree is traversed atmost once. Here, n refers to the number of nodes in the given binary tree.

Space complexity : O(m). The size of queuequeue or temptemp can grow upto atmost the maximum number of nodes at any level in the given binary tree. 
Here, m refers to the maximum mumber of nodes at any level in the input tree.

                }
            }
            
            result.add(sum / size);
            sum = 0;
        }
        
        return result;
    }

======================================================================================================

Idea:
A problem talking about levels in a binary tree should immediately bring to mind a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. 
The classic BFS approach for a binary tree is to use a queue and push each queue entry's children onto the end of the queue. 
This way, the queue will run to the end of the row/level before moving onto the next level.

When a problem requires you to isolate a level, you can simply take the length of the queue at the start of the row and then once you've 
processed that many nodes from the queue, you'll know that you're ready to start the next row.

So as long as the queue exists, we'll take each row, sum the row's values (row), then divide by the length of the row (qlen) to find the average, 
pushing each average into our answer array (ans).

Implementation:
The code for all four languages is almost identical.

class Solution {
    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>(List.of(root));
        List<Double> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while (q.size() > 0) {
            double qlen = q.size(), row = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < qlen; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = q.poll();
                row += curr.val;
                if (curr.left != null) q.offer(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) q.offer(curr.right);
            }
            ans.add(row/qlen);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
