Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originally, it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we cannot omit the first parenthesis pair to break the 
one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Solution
Approach #1 Using Recursion [Accepted]
This solution is very simple. We simply need to do the preorder traversal of the given Binary Tree.
But, along with this, we need to make use of braces at appropriate positions. But, we also need to make sure that we omit the unnecessary braces. 
To do the preorder traversal, we make use of recursion. We print the current node and call the same given function for the left and the right children 
of the node in that order(if they exist). For every node encountered, the following cases are possible.

Case 1: Both the left child and the right child exist for the current node.
        In this case, we need to put the braces () around both the left child's preorder traversal output and the right child's preorder traversal output.

Case 2: None of the left or the right child exist for the current node. 
        In this case, as shown in the figure below, considering empty braces for the null left and right children is redundant. 
        Hence, we need not put braces for any of them.

Case 3: Only the left child exists for the current node. 
        As the figure below shows, putting empty braces for the right child in this case is unnecessary while considering the preorder traversal. 
        This is because the right child will always come after the left child in the preorder traversal. 
        Thus, omitting the empty braces for the right child also leads to same mapping between the string and the binary tree.

Case 4: Only the right child exists for the current node. In this case, we need to consider the empty braces for the left child. 
        This is because, during the preorder traversal, the left child needs to be considered first. 
        Thus, to indicate that the child following the current node is a right child we need to put a pair of empty braces for the left child.

Just by taking care of the cases, mentioned above, we can obtain the required output string.

 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public String tree2str(TreeNode t) {
        if(t==null)
            return "";
        if(t.left==null && t.right==null)
            return t.val+"";
        if(t.right==null)
            return t.val+"("+tree2str(t.left)+")";
        return t.val+"("+tree2str(t.left)+")("+tree2str(t.right)+")";   
    }
}


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n). The preorder traversal is done over the nn nodes of the given Binary Tree.

Space complexity : O(n). The depth of the recursion tree can go upto nn in case of a skewed tree.

========================================================================================================================================================

Approach #2 Iterative Method Using stack [Accepted]
Algorithm

In order to solve the given problem, we can also make use of a stack. 
To see how to do it, we'll go through the implementation and we'll also look at the idea behind each step.

We make use of a stack onto which various nodes of the given tree will be pushed during the process. 
The node at the top of the stack represents the current node to be processed. Whenever a node has been processed once, it is marked as visited. 
The reasoning behind this will be discussed soon.

We start off by pushing the root of the binary tree onto the stack. Now, the root acts as the current node.
For every current node encountered, firstly, we check if it has not been visited already. If not, we add it to the set of visited nodes.

Since, for the preorder traversal, we know, we need to process the nodes in the order current-left-right. 
Thus, we add a ( followed by the current node to the string ss to be returned.

Now, if both the left and the right children of the current node exist, we need to process them in the order left-right.
To do so, we need to push them onto the stack in the reverse order, so that when they are picked up later on, their order of processing gets corrected.

Since we've already added (current_node to the string s, if only the right child of the current node exists, as discussed in case 4 in the last approach,
we need to put a () in s representing the null left node.
We need not push anything onto the stackstack for the left node and we can directly add the () to s for this.
But, we still need to push the right child onto the stackstack for future processing.

If only the left child exists, we need not consider the right child at all, as discussed in case 3 in the last approach. 
We can continue the process by just pushing the left child onto the stack.

Now, we need to note that even when a node is being processed, if it has not already been visited, it isn't popped off from the stackstack. 
But, if a node that has already been processed(i.e. its children have been considered already), it is popped off from the stackstack when encountered again. 
Such a situation will occur for a node only when the preorder traversal of both its left and right sub-trees has been completely done. Thus, we need to add a ) to mark the end of the preorder traversal of the current node as well.

Thus, at the end, we get the required pre-order traversal in the substring s(1:n-1). Here, n represents the length of s.
This is because, we need not put the parentheses(redundant) at the outermost level.

The following animation better depicts the process.


public class Solution {
    public String tree2str(TreeNode t) {
        if (t == null)
            return "";
        Stack < TreeNode > stack = new Stack < > ();
        stack.push(t);
        Set < TreeNode > visited = new HashSet < > ();
        StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder();
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            t = stack.peek();
            if (visited.contains(t)) {
                stack.pop();
                s.append(")");
            } else {
                visited.add(t);
                s.append("(" + t.val);
                if (t.left == null && t.right != null)
                    s.append("()");
                if (t.right != null)
                    stack.push(t.right);
                if (t.left != null)
                    stack.push(t.left);
            }
        }
        return s.substring(1, s.length() - 1);
    }
}
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n). n nodes are pushed and popped in a stack.

Space complexity : O(n). stack size can grow upto n.

 ===========================================================
 
 Using PRE-ORDER Traversal we can achieve our desired String. 
 At every step we add the Node Value to our GLOBAL String Ans and then add Open "(" to the string and carry on with the pre order traversal.
 Once we reach a node which doesnt have left and right nodes we add that to our ans and return . Upon Returning we will add the Closing ")" on every step.

For better Understanding refer to tutorials on how Pre-Order Traversal Works in a Binary tree.

class Solution {
    String ans="";
    public String tree2str(TreeNode root) {
        pass(root);
        return ans;
    }
    public void pass(TreeNode root){
        if(root.left==null&&root.right==null){
            ans+=root.val;
            return;}
        ans+=root.val;
        if(root.left!=null){ans+="(";pass(root.left);ans+=")";}
         if(root.left==null&&root.right!=null){ans+="()";}
        if(root.right!=null){ans+="(";pass(root.right);ans+=")";}
       
    }
