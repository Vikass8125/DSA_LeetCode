583. Delete Operation for Two Strings  [MEDIUM]
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.

In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
word1 and word2 consist of only lowercase English letters.


SOLUTION
class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int length = lcs(word1,word2);
        return word1.length() + word2.length() - 2 * length;
    }
    
    public int lcs(String text1, String text2){
        int[][] dp = new int[text1.length() + 1][text2.length() + 1];
        for(int i = 0; i <= text1.length(); i++){
            for(int j = 0; j <= text2.length(); j++){
                if(i == 0 || j == 0){
                    continue;
                }
                if(text1.charAt(i-1) == text2.charAt(j-1)){
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]; 
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[text1.length()][text2.length()];
    }

Approach #1 Using Longest Common Subsequence [Time Limit Exceeded]
Algorithm

In order to determine the minimum number of delete operations needed, we can make use of the length of the longest common sequence among the two given 
strings s1s1 and s2s2, say given by lcslcs. If we can find this lcslcs value, we can easily determine the required result as m + n - 2*lcsm+n−2∗lcs.
Here, mm and nn refer to the length of the two given strings s1s1 and s2s2.

The above equation works because in case of complete mismatch(i.e. if the two strings can't be equalized at all), the total number of delete operations 
required will be m + nm+n. Now, if there is a common sequence among the two strings of length lcslcs, we need to do lcslcs lesser deletions in both the 
strings leading to a total of 2lcs2lcs lesser deletions, which then leads to the above equation.

In order to find the length of the longest common sequence, we make use of a recursive function lcs(s1,s2,i,j) which returns the length of the 
longest common sequence among the strings s1s1 and s2s2 considering their lengths upto ii and jj respectively. For evaluating the function, we check 
if the characters s1[m-1]s1[m−1] and s2[n-1]s2[n−1] for equality. If they match, we can consider the corresponding strings upto 1 lesser lengths since the 
last characters have already been considered and add 1 to the result to be returned for strings of 1 lesser lengths. 
Thus, we make the function call lcs(s1, s2, i-1, j-1).

If the last characters don't match, we have two options, either we can consider the second last character of s1s1 and the last character of s2s2, 
or we can consider the second last character of s2s2 and the last character of s1s1. 
We need to consider the larger result obtained out of the two considerations for getting the required length.
Thus, the function call lcs(s1,s2,m,n) returns the required lcslcs value.


public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.length() + s2.length() - 2 * lcs(s1, s2, s1.length(), s2.length());
    }
    public int lcs(String s1, String s2, int m, int n) {
        if (m == 0 || n == 0)
            return 0;
        if (s1.charAt(m - 1) == s2.charAt(n - 1))
            return 1 + lcs(s1, s2, m - 1, n - 1);
        else
            return Math.max(lcs(s1, s2, m, n - 1), lcs(s1, s2, m - 1, n));
    }
}



Approach #2 Longest Common Subsequence with Memoization [Accepted]
Algorithm

We can observe that in the last approach, while determining the lcslcs value, a lot of redundant function calls are made, 
since the same mm and nn values to be used for the function calls could be obtained going through many different paths. 
We can remove this redundancy by making use of a memomemo array to store the value to be returned for these function calls if they have been 
called once with the corresponding parameters. Thus, memo[i][j]memo[i][j] is used to store the result for the function call lcs(s1,s2,i,j).

Thus, by returning the already stored values from the memomemo array, we can prune the search space to a great extent.

public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String s1, String s2) {
        int[][] memo = new int[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];
        return s1.length() + s2.length() - 2 * lcs(s1, s2, s1.length(), s2.length(), memo);
    }
    public int lcs(String s1, String s2, int m, int n, int[][] memo) {
        if (m == 0 || n == 0)
            return 0;
        if (memo[m][n] > 0)
            return memo[m][n];
        if (s1.charAt(m - 1) == s2.charAt(n - 1))
            memo[m][n] = 1 + lcs(s1, s2, m - 1, n - 1, memo);
        else
            memo[m][n] = Math.max(lcs(s1, s2, m, n - 1, memo), lcs(s1, s2, m - 1, n, memo));
        return memo[m][n];
    }
}

Approach #3 Using Longest Common Subsequence- Dynamic Programming [Accepted]
Algorithm

Another method to obtain the value of lcslcs is to make use of Dynamic Programming. We'll look at the implemenation and carry-on alongside the idea behind it.

We make use of a 2-D dpdp, in which dp[i][j]dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest common subsequence among the strings s1s1 and s2s2 considering 
their lengths upto (i-1)^{th}(i−1) 
th
  index and (j-1)^{th}(j−1) 
th
  index only respectively. We fill the dpdp array in row-by-row order.

In order to fill the entry for dp[i][j]dp[i][j], we can have two cases:

The characters s1[i-1]s1[i−1] and s2[j-1]s2[j−1] match with each other. In this case, the entry for dp[i][j]dp[i][j] will be one more than the
entry obtained for the strings considering their 
lengths upto one lesser index, since the matched character adds one to the length of LCS formed till the current indices. 
Thus, the dp[i][j]dp[i][j] entry is updated as dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]dp[i][j]=1+dp[i−1][j−1]. 
Note that dp[i-1][j-1]dp[i−1][j−1] has been used because the matched character belongs to both s1s1 and s2s2.

The characters s1[i-1]s1[i−1] and s2[j-1]s2[j−1] don't match with each other. In this case, we can't increment the current entry as 
compared to entries corresponding to the previous indices, but we need to replicate the previous entry again to indicate that the length of LCS 
upto the current indices also remains the same. But, which entry to pick up? Now, since the current character hasn't matched, we have got two options. 
We can remove the current character from consideration from either s1s1 or s2s2 and use the corresponding dpdp entries given by dp[i-1][j]dp[i−1][j] and 
dp[i][j-1]dp[i][j−1] respectively. Since we are considering the length of LCS upto the current indices we need to pick up the larger entry out of these two 
to update the current dpdp entry.

At the end, again, we obtain the number of deletions required as m + n - 2*dp[m][n]m+n−2∗dp[m][n], where mm and nn refer to the lengths of s1s1 and s2s2. 
dp[m][n]dp[m][n] now refers to the length of LCS among the two given strings.

public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String s1, String s2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= s1.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= s2.length(); j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0)
                    continue;
                if (s1.charAt(i - 1) == s2.charAt(j - 1))
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return s1.length() + s2.length() - 2 * dp[s1.length()][s2.length()];
    }
}



Approach #4 Without using LCS Dynamic Programmming [Accepted]:
Algorithm

Instead of finding the length of LCS and then determining the number of deletions required, we can make use of Dynamic Programming to directly determine 
the number of deletions required till the current indices of the strings.

In order to do so, we make use of a 2-D dpdp array. Now, dp[i][j]dp[i][j] refers to the number of deletions required to equalize the two strings 
if we consider the strings' length upto (i-1)^{th}(i−1) 
th
  index and (j-1)^{th}(j−1) 
th
  index for s1s1 and s2s2 respectively. Again, we fill in the dpdp array in a row-by-row order.
  Now, in order to fill the entry for dp[i][j]dp[i][j], we need to consider two cases only:

The characters s1[i-1]s1[i−1] and s2[j-1]s2[j−1] match with each other. In this case, we need to replicate the entry corresponding to dp[i-1][j-1]dp[i−1][j−1] itself. 
This is because, the matched character doesn't need to be deleted from any of the strings.

The characters s1[i-1]s1[i−1] and s2[j-1]s2[j−1] don't match with each other. In this case, we need to delete either the current character of s1s1 or s2s2. 
Thus, an increment of 1 needs to be done relative to the entries corresponding to the previous indices. The two options available at this moment 
are dp[i-1][j]dp[i−1][j] and dp[i][j-1]dp[i][j−1]. Since, we are keeping track of the minimum number of deletions required, we pick up the minimum out of these 
two values.

At the end, dp[m][n]dp[m][n] gives the required minimum number of deletions. Here, mm and nn refer to the lengths of s1s1 and s2s2.

public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String s1, String s2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= s1.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= s2.length(); j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0)
                    dp[i][j] = i + j;
                else if (s1.charAt(i - 1) == s2.charAt(j - 1))
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[s1.length()][s2.length()];
    }
}


Approach #5 1-D Dynamic Programming [Accepted]:
Algorithm

We can observe that in the last approach, in order to update the current dpdp entries, we need only the values of the previous row of dpdp. 
Thus, rather than using a 2-D array, we can do the same job by making use of a 1-D dpdp array.

Thus, now, dp[i]dp[i] refers to the number of deletions that need to be made in order to equalize the strings s1s1 and s2s2 if we consider 
string s1s1 upto the (i-1)^{th}(i−1) 
th
  index and string s2s2 upto the last to current index of s2s2.

Now, we make the updations for the current row in an array temptemp of the same size as dpdp, and use the dpdp entries as if they correspond to 
the previous row's entries. When, the whole temptemp array has been filled, we copy it the dpdp array so that dpdp array now reflects the new row's entries.
public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String s1, String s2) {
        int[] dp = new int[s2.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= s1.length(); i++) {
            int[] temp=new int[s2.length()+1];
            for (int j = 0; j <= s2.length(); j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0)
                    temp[j] = i + j;
                else if (s1.charAt(i - 1) == s2.charAt(j - 1))
                    temp[j] = dp[j - 1];
                else
                    temp[j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[j], temp[j - 1]);
            }
            dp=temp;
        }
        return dp[s2.length()];
    }
}
